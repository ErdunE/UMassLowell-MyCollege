Translate source code from C to C ++
1. I used cout to eliminate each printf statement. I replaced the c=getchar() method with the cinc.get (c) method.
2. The program needs white space to separate each token, otherwise the program may not be able to tell whether ab is an identifier or two identifiers :a and b. Therefore, our program requires that all input tokens be separated by white space.
