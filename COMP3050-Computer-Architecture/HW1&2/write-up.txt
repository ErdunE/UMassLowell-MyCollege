I think my degree of success is 100% against the test data.

My approach is straightfoward. I started with the template. I added code for handling rounding.
I also consider denormalized cases. The addition is basically shift and add, with additional
check when there is an extra bit to the left of the hidden bit of the result.

I think I solved most problems in this assignment.
