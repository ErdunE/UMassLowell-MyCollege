I think my degree of success is 80% against the test data.

The reason of the process rate is only 80% is that my Assignment 5's code is not fully splited up.
It is hard for me to split the code. And writing a linker is also not easy.
It is not easy to parse the text. It is also a hard point to find the right address for every subprocess.

I think I solved most problems in this assignment.
