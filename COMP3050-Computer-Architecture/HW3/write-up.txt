I think my degree of success is 60%.

My approach for this project was first research on Fibonacci number.
In the mic-1 program describe the formation of a Fibonacci number.
Described the Fibonacci recursive then described the values to be used as arguments.  
The problem encountered was proper display of the results and defining the results to be displayed.

I think I solved most of all problems in this assignment.
