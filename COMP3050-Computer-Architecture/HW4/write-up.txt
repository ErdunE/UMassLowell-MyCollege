I think my degree of success is 100% against the test data.

I follow the directions in the assignment and started with the given code. 
RSHIFT code is given so I just use it as it is. For MULT, I use an appraoch similar to 
Booth's algorithm for better performace. DIV is simply a series of subtraction (e.g.) add the
2's complement of the divisor.

I think I solved most problems in this assignment.
