/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/

This assignment implemented a dynamic celestial simulation program. 
When I finished it, I was immediately shocked by my own results.
Very interesting. It not only exercised my c++ programming ability, 
but also reviewed some physics knowledge, and deeply realized how important 
physics is in the game.

  /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/

The key to this project was to calculate the gravitational force. I tried 
various methods. It was very different from the reference data, so I thought
 about the planets being pulled by all the other planets, and after trying, 
 I found that everything was normal.




/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Describe if and how do you used the smart pointers 
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/

I implemented this celestial simulation program, which can read the initial
 data and perform calculations based on physical knowledge.

 **********************************************************************/
It could be that my computer is out of memory or the program itself, which causes it to get a little stuck whenever I run it. But not a big problem
