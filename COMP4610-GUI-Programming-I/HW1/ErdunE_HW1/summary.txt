Web developers include front-end and cutting-edge and full stack. The full stack means people who can work at the tip and at the same time, although this does not mean that you have to master the front end and everything you need from it , but you can understand what is happening on both sides at work. The front end usually refers to the part that the user can see, while the extension refers to the program logic, database interaction, authentication, etc. If you want to be a full-stack developer, you need to learn at least HTML, Javascript, database, HTTP, Web application architecture, Git and basic algorithms and data structures. The front end is mainly HTML, CSS, Javascript, front-end framework. Back-end Majors are Go, Java and other back-end programming languages, databases, operating systems, network programming and security. Of course, some basic front-end knowledge is also required, because the back-end needs to interact with the front-end. Those who can further become Dev-Ops developers also need to know about management servers, infrastructure as code, some CI/CD tools and logs management. Finally, after completing the roadmap, you have to keep learning, this is a developer must have Persist, otherwise you will be eliminated.
